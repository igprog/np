        <h1>How to create a balanced diet</h1>
        <h2><em>Using web application <strong>Nutri Prog</strong></em></h2>
        
        <p>
            Creating a balanced menu for a healthy person is preceded by fact-finding
            states through several steps:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>determination of anthropometric values,</li>
                <li>determining energy needs</li>
                <li>analysis of existing eating habits based on dietary diaries and</li>
                <li>talking to the person for whom the menu is being made.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>ANTHROPOMETRIC SIZES</h2>
        <p>
            Some anthropometric quantities are directly measured (directly), such as body size
            weight, body height, bands (waist and hips), and other sizes are derived sizes from
            anthropometric quantities are an immediate indicator of nutrition, such as
            body mass index, waist to hip ratio, etc.
        </p>
            
        <h3>Body mass</h3>
        <p>
            Body weight is expressed in kilograms (kg) and determined by weighing. It is recommended that
            it is the morning after urination and defecation whereby the person is barefoot and dressed in light clothing.
        </p>
            
            Body height
            Body height is expressed in meters (m) or centimeters (cm). The person to be measured
            the height should be upright, looking straight, bent legs, barefoot and heels resting
            altimeter.
            Body mass index
            Determination of Body Mass Index (BMI) is today
            the most widespread way to connect body weight and height. BMI is used because of
            great connections with body composition. This parameter, as well as the degree information
            can be determined by computer program Nutrition Program.
            Note: Body mass index is not used to determine the nutritional status of pregnant women and athletes.
            BMI of physically active people is often greater than 25 kg / m2, but it is important to know that this is not the case
            about the increased mass of fat, but already about the increased muscle mass.
            Speaking of the general population, higher BMIs are associated with an increased risk of high
            blood pressure, diabetes mellitus II. type of heart and blood vessels disease. Its significant increase in
            later age greatly increases the incidence of ischemic heart disease. It is
            weight gain is positively correlated with gallstones, liver disease,
            the postoperative complications of that death during operations. Complications associated with arthritis,
            especially the hips and knees, are more common in people of disproportionately high body weight. Obesity
            is associated with colon cancer, prostate cancer in men and breasts,
            uterus and ovary in women. Malnutrition, on the other hand, is associated with higher mortality
            due to lung and gallbladder cancer.
            Determination of fat content
            The determination of adipose tissue can be performed in a number of ways including use
            calipers, underwater weighing, DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), analysis
            26
            bioelectrical impedance, fat content calculation according to Young Men's Christian
            Association (YMCA), etc. It is especially useful in cases of increased BMI,
            when the determination of fat content indicates whether it is an increased fat content or
            not. An interpretation of the fat content values ​​is shown in Table 1.
            Table 1. Interpretation of fat content values
            Content of adipose tissue in
            woman (%)
            Content of adipose tissue in
            men (%)
            Essential fat values ​​in the body 10 - 13 2 - 5
            Values ​​in athletes 14 - 20 6 - 13
            Recommended values ​​21 - 24 14 - 17
            Acceptable Values ​​25 - 31 18 - 25
            Values ​​indicating obesity 32 and above 26 and above
            Waist to hip ratio
            Determining the ratio of waist to hip circumference shows the type of body build, that is, u
            which part of the body stores fat.
            According to the area of ​​concentration of adipose tissue on the body, the following are distinguished:
            - an android type (apple shaped) whereby fat is concentrated in the upper part
            bodies and
            - ginoid type (pear shaped) whereby the fat is concentrated in the lower part
            body.
            The measuring tape measures waist and hip circumferences and divides waist circumference by circumference
            hips. The abbreviation of this term is WHR (waist-hip ratio), and its interpretation of values
            shows the computer program Nutrition Program.
            Increased accumulation of fatty tissue in the waist area has the potential to occur
            various diseases (eg diabetes and heart disease). The risk of these diseases in women
            it is enlarged if the waist circumference is 80 to 88 cm, and very high when it is greater than 88 cm. Risk
            for men it is enlarged if the waist circumference is from 94 to 102 cm and very high when it is larger
            from 102 cm.
